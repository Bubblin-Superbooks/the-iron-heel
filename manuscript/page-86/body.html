But it occurred a century and a half ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And there, a century and a half ago, originated the modern proletariat,&rdquo; Ernest continued. &ldquo;And the Church ignored it. While a slaughter-house was made of the nation by the capitalist, the Church was dumb. It did not protest, as to-day it does not protest. As Austin Lewis* says, speaking of that time, those to whom the command 'Feed my lambs' had been given, saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked to death without a protest.** The Church was dumb, then, and before I go on I want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree with me.
