At five in the morning I dressed and abandoned my bed.</p><p>I asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was, and she told me two hours. She was a mulatto woman, and I noticed that her face was haggard, with great circles under the eyes, while the eyes themselves were wide with some haunting fear.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, miss; I didn't sleep well, I guess,&rdquo; was her reply.</p><p>I looked at her closely, and tried her with one of our signals. She responded, and I made sure of her.</p></div> </div>
