Will you kindly explain what has so long puzzled wiser heads than yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Ernest answered. His cocksureness irritated them. &ldquo;The wise heads have puzzled so sorely over truth because they went up into the air after it. Had they remained on the solid earth, they would have found it easily enough&mdash;ay, they would have found that they themselves were precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The test, the test,&rdquo; Dr. Hammerfield repeated impatiently. &ldquo;Never mind the preamble. Give us that which we have sought so long&mdash;the test of truth. Give it us, and we will be as gods.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
