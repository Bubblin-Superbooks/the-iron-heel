These deposits are saved for old age, for sickness and accident, and for funeral expenses. The savings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the shelf to be eaten next day. No, labor consumes all of the total product that its wages will buy back.</p><p>&ldquo;Two billions are left to capital. After it has paid its expenses, does it consume the remainder? Does capital consume all of its two billions?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
