<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is, of course, no reflection on you,&rdquo; Ernest said. &ldquo;Every man to his trade. Only you stick to your trade, and I'll stick to mine. You have specialized. When it comes to a knowledge of the law, of how best to evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving corporations, I am down in the dirt at your feet. But when it comes to sociology&mdash;my trade&mdash;you are down in the dirt at my feet. Remember that. Remember, also, that your law is the stuff of a day, and that you are not versatile in the stuff of more than a day. Therefore your dogmatic assertions and rash generalizations on things historical and sociological are not worth the breath you waste on them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
