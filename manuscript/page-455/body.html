<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Simply by subsidizing the great unions. They won't join in the next general strike. Therefore it won't be a general strike.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the Iron Heel can't maintain so costly a programme forever,&rdquo; I objected.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it hasn't subsidized all of the unions. That's not necessary. Here is what is going to happen. Wages are going to be advanced and hours shortened in the railroad unions, the iron and steel workers unions, and the engineer and machinist unions. In these unions more favorable conditions will continue to prevail. Membership in these unions will become like seats in Paradise.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
