They're not healthy here, but I can't afford to send them away.&rdquo;</p><p>When I started to leave, he dropped back into his whine.</p><p>&ldquo;I hadn't the ghost of a chance. Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell are pretty friendly. I'm not saying that if I'd got the right kind of testimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination, that friendship would have decided the case. And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony. Why, Judge Caldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club. They live in the same neighborhood&mdash;one I can't afford. And their wives are always in and out of each other's houses. They're always having whist parties and such things back and forth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
