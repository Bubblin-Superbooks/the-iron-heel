It was at this time that Senator Mark Hanna said: &ldquo;The production of wealth in the United States is one-third larger annually than its consumption.&rdquo; Also a fellow-Senator, Chauncey Depew, said: &ldquo;The American people produce annually two billions more wealth than they consume.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
