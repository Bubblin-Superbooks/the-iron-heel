Ernest called it the dinner of the Machine Breakers. In point of fact, it was merely a dinner for business men&mdash;small business men, of course. I doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total capitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars. They were truly representative middle-class business men.</p><p>There was Owen, of Silverberg, Owen & Company&mdash;a large grocery firm with several branch stores. We bought our groceries from them. There were both partners of the big drug firm of Kowalt & Washburn, and Mr. Asmunsen, the owner of a large granite quarry in Contra Costa County. And there were many similar men, owners or part-owners in small factories, small businesses and small industries&mdash;small capitalists, in short.</p></div> </div>
