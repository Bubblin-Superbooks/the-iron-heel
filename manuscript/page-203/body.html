<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society. You have not answered. You have made no attempt to answer. Why? Is it because you have no answer? You are the champion of this whole audience. Every one here, except me, is hanging on your lips for that answer. They are hanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer themselves. As for me, as I said before, I know that you not only cannot answer, but that you will not attempt an answer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is intolerable!&rdquo; Colonel Van Gilbert cried out. &ldquo;This is insult!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That you should not answer is intolerable,&rdquo; Ernest replied gravely. &ldquo;No man can be intellectually insulted. Insult, in its very nature, is emotional. Recover yourself. Give me an intellectual answer to my intellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
