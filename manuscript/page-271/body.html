<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of England. And while you maunder about restoring competition, the trusts go on destroying you.</p><p>&ldquo;One and all you tell the same story,&mdash;the passing away of competition and the coming on of combination. You, Mr. Owen, destroyed competition here in Berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries out of business. Your combination was more effective. Yet you feel the pressure of other combinations on you, the trust combinations, and you cry out. It is because you are not a trust. If you were a grocery trust for the whole United States, you would be singing another song. And the song would be, 'Blessed are the trusts.' And yet again, not only is your small combination not a trust, but you are aware yourself of its lack of strength. You are beginning to divine your own end. You feel yourself and your branch stores a pawn in the game.</p></div> </div>
