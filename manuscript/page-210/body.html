It is what we of the working class preach. We know, and well we know by bitter experience, that no appeal for the right, for justice, for humanity, can ever touch you. Your hearts are hard as your heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor. So we have preached power. By the power of our ballots on election day will we take your government away from you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if you do get a majority, a sweeping majority, on election day?&rdquo; Mr. Wickson broke in to demand. &ldquo;Suppose we refuse to turn the government over to you after you have captured it at the ballot-box?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
