I knew I must do it secretly, else they would have taken everything away from me. That would have been terrible.

I never did a bit of work in my life, except to appeal aesthetically to Pharisees&mdash;I thought I was preaching the message&mdash;and yet I was worth half a million dollars. I never knew what half a million dollars meant until I realized how much potatoes and bread and butter and meat it could buy. And then I realized something more. I realized that all those potatoes and that bread and butter and meat were mine, and that I had not worked to make them.</p></div> </div>
