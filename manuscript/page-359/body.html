<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Black Hundreds were a development out of the secret agents of the capitalists, and their use arose in the labor struggles of the nineteenth century. There is no discussion of this. No less an authority of the times than Carroll D. Wright, United States Commissioner of Labor, is responsible for the statement. From his book, entitled &ldquo;The Battles of Labor,&rdquo; is quoted the declaration that &ldquo;in some of the great historic strikes the employers themselves have instigated acts of violence;&rdquo; that manufacturers have deliberately provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock; and that freight cars have been burned by employers' agents during railroad strikes in order to increase disorder. It was out of these secret agents of the employers that the Black Hundreds arose; and it was they, in turn, that later became that terrible weapon of the Oligarchy, the agents- provocateurs.</p></div> </div>
