Here is a man who works on the street railways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He couldn't work if it weren't for capital,&rdquo; the Bishop interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;True, and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no labor to earn the dividends.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop was silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Won't you?&rdquo; Ernest insisted.</p><p>The Bishop nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Then our statements cancel each other,&rdquo; Ernest said in a matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;and we are where we were. Now to begin again. The workingmen on the street railway furnish the labor. The stockholders furnish the capital. By the joint effort of the workingmen and the capital, money is earned.* They divide between them this money that is earned. Capital's share is called 'dividends.' Labor's share is called 'wages.'&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
