<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The tears were in his eyes, this great, strong hero of mine. He never could forgive the way his father had been malformed&mdash;the sordid lies and the petty thefts he had been compelled to, in order to put food in his children's mouths.</p><p>&ldquo;My father was a good man,&rdquo; Ernest once said to me. &ldquo;The soul of him was good, and yet it was twisted, and maimed, and blunted by the savagery of his life. He was made into a broken-down beast by his masters, the arch-beasts. He should be alive to-day, like your father. He had a strong constitution. But he was caught in the machine and worked to death&mdash;for profit. Think of it. For profit&mdash;his life blood transmuted into a wine-supper, or a jewelled gewgaw, or some similar sense-orgy of the parasitic and idle rich, his masters, the arch-beasts.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
