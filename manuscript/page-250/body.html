In spite of taking in washing, she got behind in her rent. Yesterday they evicted her. But first, she hoisted an American flag, and from under its folds she announced that by virtue of its protection they could not turn her out on to the cold street. What was done? She was arrested and arraigned for insanity. To-day she was examined by the regular insanity experts. She was found insane. She was consigned to the Napa Asylum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that is far-fetched,&rdquo; I objected. &ldquo;Suppose I should disagree with everybody about the literary style of a book. They wouldn't send me to an asylum for that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
