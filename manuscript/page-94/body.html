I will take you on a journey through hell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I shall protest.&rdquo; The Bishop straightened himself in his chair, and over his gentle face spread the harshness of the warrior. &ldquo;The Church shall not be dumb!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be discharged,&rdquo; was the warning.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall prove the contrary,&rdquo; was the retort. &ldquo;I shall prove, if what you say is so, that the Church has erred through ignorance. And, furthermore, I hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is due to the ignorance of the capitalist class. It will mend all that is wrong as soon as it receives the message. And this message it shall be the duty of the Church to deliver.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
