<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For six years the rebuilding of San Francisco had been going on, and his business had quadrupled and octupled, and yet he was no better off.</p><p>&ldquo;The railroad knows my business just a little bit better than I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It knows my operating expenses to a cent, and it knows the terms of my contracts. How it knows these things I can only guess. It must have spies in my employ, and it must have access to the parties to all my contracts. For look you, when I place a big contract, the terms of which favor me a goodly profit, the freight rate from my quarry to market is promptly raised. No explanation is made. The railroad gets my profit. Under such circumstances I have never succeeded in getting the railroad to reconsider its raise.</p></div> </div>
