You must become another woman&mdash;and not merely in the clothes you wear, but inside your skin under the clothes. You must make yourself over again so that even I would not know you&mdash;your voice, your gestures, your mannerisms, your carriage, your walk, everything.&rdquo;</p><p>This command I obeyed. Every day I practised for hours in burying forever the old Avis Everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom I may call my other self. It was only by long practice that such results could be obtained. In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised almost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed, automatic. It was this automatic assumption of a role that was considered imperative. One must become so adept as to deceive oneself. It was like learning a new language, say the French.</p></div> </div>
