<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I nodded at recollection of the vulpine-face superintendent of the Sierra Mills.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I got him first,&rdquo; Donnelly said with pride. &ldquo;'Twas after that I joined the Reds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how comes it that you are here?&rdquo; I queried. &ldquo;Your wife and children?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That's why. No,&rdquo; he went on hastily, &ldquo;'tis not revenge for them. They died easily in their beds&mdash;sickness, you see, one time and another. They tied my arms while they lived.
