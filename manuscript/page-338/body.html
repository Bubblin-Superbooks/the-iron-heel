It seemed almost that they were scared by the vision of the times they had seen. &ldquo;The situation is, indeed, serious,&rdquo; Mr. Calvin said to Ernest. &ldquo;I have little quarrel with the way you have depicted it. Only I disagree with you about the doom of the middle class. We shall survive, and we shall overthrow the trusts.&rdquo; &ldquo;And return to the ways of your fathers,&rdquo; Ernest finished for him. &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; Mr. Calvin answered gravely. &ldquo;I know it's a sort of machine-breaking, and that it is absurd. But then life seems absurd to-day, what of the machinations of the Plutocracy. And at any rate, our sort of machine-breaking is at least practical and possible, which your dream is not. Your socialistic dream is . . . well, a dream.</p></div> </div>
