Epitomized their doctrine was: &ldquo;Why should the workingmen of one country fight with the workingmen of another country for the benefit of their capitalist masters?&rdquo; On May 21, 1905 A.D., when war threatened between Austria and Italy, the socialists of Italy, Austria, and Hungary held a conference at Trieste, and threatened a general strike of the workingmen of both countries in case war was declared. This was repeated the following year, when the &ldquo;Morocco Affair&rdquo; threatened to involve France, Germany, and England.</p><p>The German socialists were ready to act with us. There were over five million of them, many of them in the standing army, and, in addition, they were on friendly terms with the labor unions.</p></div> </div>
