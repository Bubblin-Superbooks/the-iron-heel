<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Can the United States do what she previously did&mdash;get rid of her surplus to Brazil? No, for Brazil now has a surplus, too.</p><p>&ldquo;What happens? The United States and Brazil must both seek out other countries with undeveloped resources, in order to unload the surpluses on them. But by the very process of unloading the surpluses, the resources of those countries are in turn developed. Soon they have surpluses, and are seeking other countries on which to unload. Now, gentlemen, follow me. The planet is only so large. There are only so many countries in the world. What will happen when every country in the world, down to the smallest and last, with a surplus in its hands, stands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
