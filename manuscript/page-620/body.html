<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In all truth, there in the labor-ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so dreadfully&mdash;but it is the beast of their own making. In it they will not let the ape and tiger die.</p><p>And just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed for the building of Asgard, the projected wonder-city that will far exceed Ardis when the latter is completed.* We of the Revolution will go on with that great work, but it will not be done by the miserable serfs. The walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to the sound of singing, and into its beauty and wonder will be woven, not sighs and groans, but music and laughter.</p></div> </div>
