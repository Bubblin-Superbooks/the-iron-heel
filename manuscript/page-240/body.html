If Jesus was right, then these two unfortunates were my sisters, and the only hope of their purification was in my affection and tenderness.</p><p>&ldquo;I live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco. The house in which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars, and its furnishings, books, and works of art cost as much more. The house is a mansion. No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants. I never knew what palaces were good for. I had thought they were to live in. But now I know. I took the two women of the street to my palace, and they are going to stay with me. I hope to fill every room in my palace with such sisters as they.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
