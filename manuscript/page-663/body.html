As the front of it passed under the warring buildings, both went into action again&mdash;one building dropping bombs into the street, being attacked from across the street, and in return replying to that attack.

We could not escape. The next moment the front of the column went by. It was not a column, but a mob, an awful river that filled the street, the people of the abyss, mad with drink and wrong, up at last and roaring for the blood of their masters.</p></div> </div>
