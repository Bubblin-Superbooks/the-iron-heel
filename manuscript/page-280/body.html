Then Mr. Kowalt spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;What are we to do, then?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;To destroy the trusts is the only way we can see to escape their domination.&rdquo;</p><p>Ernest was all fire and aliveness on the instant.</p><p>&ldquo;I'll show you another way!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let us not destroy those wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply. Let us control them. Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness. Let us run them for ourselves. Let us oust the present owners of the wonderful machines, and let us own the wonderful machines ourselves. That, gentlemen, is socialism, a greater combination than the trusts, a greater economic and social combination than any that has as yet appeared on the planet. It is in line with evolution. We meet combination with greater combination. It is the winning side. Come on over with us socialists and play on the winning side.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
