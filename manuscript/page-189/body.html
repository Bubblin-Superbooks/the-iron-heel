<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the United States to-day there are fifteen million* people living in poverty; and by poverty is meant that condition in life in which, through lack of food and adequate shelter, the mere standard of working efficiency cannot be maintained. In the United States to-day, in spite of all your so-called labor legislation, there are three millions of child laborers.** In twelve years their numbers have been doubled. And in passing I will ask you managers of society why you did not make public the census figures of 1910? And I will answer for you, that you were afraid. The figures of misery would have precipitated the revolution that even now is gathering.</p><p>* Robert Hunter, in 1906, in a book entitled &ldquo;Poverty,&rdquo; pointed out that at that time there were ten millions in the United States living in poverty.</p></div> </div>
