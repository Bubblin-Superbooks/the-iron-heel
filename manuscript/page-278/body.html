<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is the fiat of evolution. It is the word of God. Combination is stronger than competition. Primitive man was a puny creature hiding in the crevices of the rocks. He combined and made war upon his carnivorous enemies. They were competitive beasts. Primitive man was a combinative beast, and because of it he rose to primacy over all the animals. And man has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since. It is combination versus competition, a thousand centuries long struggle, in which competition has always been worsted. Whoso enlists on the side of competition perishes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the trusts themselves arose out of competition,&rdquo; Mr. Calvin interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; Ernest answered. &ldquo;And the trusts themselves destroyed competition. That, by your own word, is why you are no longer in the dairy business.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
