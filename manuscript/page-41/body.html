<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Philosophy is&mdash;&rdquo; (Dr. Hammerfield paused and cleared his throat)&mdash;&ldquo;something that cannot be defined comprehensively except to such minds and temperaments as are philosophical. The narrow scientist with his nose in a test-tube cannot understand philosophy.&rdquo;</p><p>Ernest ignored the thrust. It was always his way to turn the point back upon an opponent, and he did it now, with a beaming brotherliness of face and utterance.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you will undoubtedly understand the definition I shall now make of philosophy. But before I make it, I shall challenge you to point out error in it or to remain a silent metaphysician. Philosophy is merely the widest science of all. Its reasoning method is the same as that of any particular science and of all particular sciences. And by that same method of reasoning, the inductive method, philosophy fuses all particular sciences into one great science.</p></div> </div>
