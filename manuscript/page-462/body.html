<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>* Everhard's social foresight was remarkable. As clearly as in the light of past events, he saw the defection of the favored unions, the rise and the slow decay of the labor castes, and the struggle between the decaying oligarchs and labor castes for control of the great governmental machine.</p><p>&ldquo;But if the Oligarchy persists,&rdquo; I asked him that evening, &ldquo;what will become of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The surpluses will have to be expended somehow,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and trust the oligarchs to find a way. Magnificent roads will be built. There will be great achievements in science, and especially in art. When the oligarchs have completely mastered the people, they will have time to spare for other things. They will become worshippers of beauty. They will become art-lovers.</p></div> </div>
