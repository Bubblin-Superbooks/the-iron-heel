<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is not at all remarkable that this same note should have been struck by the Church a generation or so later in relation to the defence of capitalistic property. In the great museum at Asgard there is a book entitled &ldquo;Essays in Application,&rdquo; written by Henry van Dyke. The book was published in 1905 of the Christian Era. From what we can make out, Van Dyke must have been a churchman. The book is a good example of what Everhard would have called bourgeois thinking. Note the similarity between the utterance of the Charleston Baptist Association quoted above, and the following utterance of Van Dyke seventy years later: &ldquo;The Bible teaches that God owns the world. He distributes to every man according to His own good pleasure, conformably to general laws.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
