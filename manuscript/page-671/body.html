<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A devilish pandemonium reigned,&mdash;shrieks, curses, and cries of death, while above all rose the churning rattle of machine-guns and the put-a-put, put-a-put of rifles. At first I could make out nothing. People were falling about me right and left. The woman in front doubled up and went down, her hands on her abdomen in a frenzied clutch. A man was quivering against my legs in a death-struggle.</p><p>It came to me that we were at the head of the column. Half a mile of it had disappeared&mdash;where or how I never learned. To this day I do not know what became of that half-mile of humanity&mdash;whether it was blotted out by some frightful bolt of war, whether it was scattered and destroyed piecemeal, or whether it escaped. But there we were, at the head of the column instead of in its middle, and we were being swept out of life by a torrent of shrieking lead.</p></div> </div>
