<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I took up a pair of trousers and examined her work.</p><p>&ldquo;Six cents, lady,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head gently while she went on stitching. She stitched slowly, but never did she cease from stitching. She seemed mastered by the verb &ldquo;to stitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that work?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Is that what they pay? How long does it take you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that is what they pay. Six cents for finishing. Two hours' sewing on each pair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the boss doesn't know that,&rdquo; she added quickly, betraying a fear of getting him into trouble. &ldquo;I'm slow. I've got the rheumatism in my hands. Girls work much faster. They finish in half that time. The boss is kind. He lets me take the work home, now that I am old and the noise of the machine bothers my head. If it wasn't for his kindness, I'd starve.</p></div> </div>
