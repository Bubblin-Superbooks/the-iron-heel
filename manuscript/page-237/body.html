Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable world of ours. He is going to deliver his message. He has told me so, and I cannot dissuade him. To-night he is chairman of the I.P.H.,* and he will embody his message in his introductory remarks.</p><p>* There is no clew to the name of the organization for which these initials stand.</p><p>&ldquo;May I bring you to hear him? Of course, he is foredoomed to futility. It will break your heart&mdash;it will break his; but for you it will be an excellent object lesson. You know, dear heart, how proud I am because you love me. And because of that I want you to know my fullest value, I want to redeem, in your eyes, some small measure of my unworthiness.</p></div> </div>
