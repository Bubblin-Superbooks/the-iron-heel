Hill with his control of the Northwest; (2) the Pennsylvania railway group, Schiff financial manager, with big banking firms of Philadelphia and New York; (3) Harriman, with Frick for counsel and Odell as political lieutenant, controlling the central continental, Southwestern and Southern Pacific Coast lines of transportation; (4) the Gould family railway interests; and (5) Moore, Reid, and Leeds, known as the &ldquo;Rock Island crowd.&rdquo; These strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of competition and travelled the inevitable road toward combination.</p></div> </div>
